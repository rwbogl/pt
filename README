This is a collection of programs to find good probable primality tests. The
tests are higher-order generalizations of Fermat's primality test, similar to
the [Perrin primality
test](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/PerrinPseudoprime.html). For more
information, see the brilliant paper [Lots and Lots of Perrin-Type Primality
Tests and Their Pseudo-Primes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.16069).
